# API Integration Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Teams Endpoint Integration
**Problem**: Frontend was expecting flat team array but backend returns nested structure
**Solution**: Updated frontend to handle `{ teams: [...] }` response format

### 2. Exhibition Simulation Request Format
**Problem**: Frontend sending wrong field names and data types
- Was sending: `{ homeTeamId: "1", awayTeamId: "2" }`
- Backend expects: `{ home_team: "KC", away_team: "BUF" }`
**Solution**: Changed to send team abbreviations with correct field names

### 3. Exhibition Simulation Response Parsing
**Problem**: Frontend not parsing structured API response correctly
**Solution**: Added proper response parsing for `{ success: true, game_result: {...} }` format

### 4. Team Selection Logic
**Problem**: Using inconsistent ID vs abbreviation for team filtering
**Solution**: Standardized on abbreviations throughout

## API Endpoints Working

### Teams API (`/api/teams/`)
```json
{
  "teams": [
    {
      "abbreviation": "KC",
      "name": "Chiefs",
      "city": "Kansas City",
      "conference": "AFC",
      "division": "West"
    }
  ],
  "total_teams": 32
}
```

### Exhibition Simulation (`/api/exhibition/simulate`)
**Request:**
```json
{
  "home_team": "KC",
  "away_team": "BUF"
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "game_result": {
    "home_team": { "abbreviation": "KC", "name": "Chiefs", "city": "Kansas City", "score": 24 },
    "away_team": { "abbreviation": "BUF", "name": "Bills", "city": "Buffalo", "score": 21 },
    "winner": { "team": {...}, "margin": 3 }
  }
}
```

## Status
✅ Teams loading from backend (all 32 NFL teams)
✅ Exhibition game simulation working
✅ Error handling with fallback to mock data
✅ Frontend-backend communication established
