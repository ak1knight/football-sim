## üéÆ USAGE EXAMPLES

### Basic Game Simulation
```python
from data.team_loader import load_sample_teams
from simulation.game_engine import GameEngine

teams = load_sample_teams()
engine = GameEngine(seed=42)
result = engine.simulate_game(teams[0], teams[1])
print(f"Final: {result.away_score} - {result.home_score}")
```

### Play-by-Play Reporting
```python
engine = GameEngine(enable_reporting=True, verbose=True)
result = engine.simulate_game(home_team, away_team)
print(engine.reporter.get_detailed_report())
```

### API Usage (Ready for React)
```python
from api.simulation_api import SimulationAPI
from api.team_api import TeamAPI

sim_api = SimulationAPI()
team_api = TeamAPI()

# Get all teams
teams = team_api.get_all_teams()

# Simulate game
result = sim_api.simulate_game(1, 2)  # Team IDs
```
