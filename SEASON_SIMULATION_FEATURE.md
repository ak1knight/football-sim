# Season Simulation Feature

## Overview

The Season Simulation feature provides comprehensive NFL season management and simulation capabilities. It allows users to create full seasons, simulate games individually or in batches, track standings, and manage playoff scenarios.

## Backend Implementation

### Core Components

1. **SeasonEngine** (`backend/simulation/season_engine.py`)
   - Core season management logic
   - Handles scheduling, standings tracking, and game result processing
   - Supports pluggable schedule generators (NFL format by default)

2. **SeasonAPI** (`backend/api/season_api.py`)
   - High-level API wrapper for season operations
   - Handles season creation, game management, and standings queries
   - Provides clean data structures for frontend consumption

3. **Season Blueprint** (`backend/api/season_blueprint.py`)
   - Flask REST endpoints for season management
   - Integrates with game simulation engine
   - Provides comprehensive simulation controls

### Available Endpoints

#### Season Management
- `POST /api/season/create` - Create a new season
- `GET /api/season/status` - Get current season status
- `GET /api/season/teams` - Get all teams organized by conference/division

#### Game Management  
- `GET /api/season/next-games` - Get next games ready for simulation
- `GET /api/season/week/{week}` - Get all games for a specific week
- `POST /api/season/simulate-game` - Simulate a single game
- `POST /api/season/simulate-week` - Simulate all games in a week
- `POST /api/season/simulate-to-week` - Simulate through a target week
- `POST /api/season/simulate-season` - Simulate the entire remaining season

#### Standings & Analytics
- `GET /api/season/standings` - Get current standings (by division or conference)
- `GET /api/season/team/{abbreviation}/schedule` - Get team's complete schedule
- `GET /api/season/playoffs` - Get playoff picture and scenarios

## Frontend Implementation

### Store Architecture

**SeasonStore** (`frontend/src/stores/SeasonStore.ts`)
- MobX-based reactive state management
- Handles API communication and data caching
- Provides computed properties for UI state
- Manages simulation loading states and error handling

Key state properties:
- `currentSeason` - Active season status and metadata
- `teams` - All teams organized by conference/division
- `nextGames` - Games ready for simulation
- `standings` - Current league standings
- `simulationResults` - Recent simulation results

### Component Structure

**SeasonManagement** (`frontend/src/components/SeasonManagement.tsx`)
Main container component with four tabs:

1. **Setup Tab**
   - Season creation and configuration
   - Team overview and league structure
   - Season status dashboard with progress indicators

2. **Schedule Tab**
   - Game scheduling and simulation controls
   - Week-by-week game browsing
   - Individual game simulation
   - Batch simulation options (week, multiple weeks, full season)

3. **Standings Tab**  
   - Division and conference standings
   - Team records and statistics
   - Win percentage, point differential, division/conference records

4. **Playoffs Tab**
   - Playoff bracket management (future enhancement)
   - Seeding scenarios and wild card races

## Key Features

### Season Creation
- Automated NFL-style scheduling (17 weeks, 32 teams)
- Configurable season year and random seed
- Comprehensive team loading with division/conference structure

### Game Simulation
- Individual game simulation with detailed results
- Week-based batch simulation
- Multi-week simulation (e.g., simulate 3 weeks ahead)
- Full season simulation
- Weather effects and realistic game duration
- Overtime handling

### Advanced Simulation Controls
- **Single Game**: Simulate one specific game
- **Current Week**: Simulate all remaining games in current week
- **Multi-Week**: Simulate multiple weeks at once
- **Full Season**: Simulate entire remaining regular season
- **Seeded Simulation**: Use random seeds for reproducible results

### Standings Management
- Real-time standings updates after each game
- Division and conference views
- Comprehensive team statistics:
  - Win-Loss-Tie records
  - Win percentage
  - Points for/against and differential
  - Division and conference records
- Automatic sorting by NFL tiebreaker rules

### Data Persistence
- Season state maintained during session
- Game results permanently recorded
- Team records updated in real-time
- Historical game data preserved

## Usage Examples

### Creating a New Season
```typescript
// Frontend usage
await seasonStore.createSeason(2024, 12345); // Year 2024, seed 12345

// Backend API
POST /api/season/create
{
  "season_year": 2024,
  "seed": 12345
}
```

### Simulating Games
```typescript
// Simulate single game
await seasonStore.simulateGame('2024_W01_G001');

// Simulate current week
await seasonStore.simulateWeek();

// Simulate through week 8
await seasonStore.simulateToWeek(8);

// Simulate full season
await seasonStore.simulateFullSeason();
```

### Getting Standings
```typescript
// Load division standings
await seasonStore.loadStandings(true);

// Load conference standings  
await seasonStore.loadStandings(false);
```

## Technical Implementation Details

### Season Engine Architecture
- **Pluggable Schedule Generation**: Supports different league formats
- **Game State Management**: Tracks scheduled, in-progress, and completed games
- **Record Tracking**: Maintains comprehensive team statistics
- **Phase Management**: Handles regular season, playoffs, and offseason

### API Design Patterns
- **Consistent Response Format**: All endpoints return `{success: boolean, ...data}` 
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error messages and status codes
- **Data Validation**: Input validation and sanitization
- **Pagination Support**: Limit parameters for large data sets

### Frontend State Management
- **Reactive Updates**: MobX automatically updates UI when data changes
- **Optimistic Updates**: UI updates immediately with loading states
- **Error Recovery**: Graceful error handling with user feedback
- **Data Caching**: Minimizes API calls through intelligent caching

## Testing

Run the test script to validate core functionality:
```bash
cd backend
python test_season_endpoints.py
```

This will:
1. Create a new season
2. Load teams and schedule
3. Simulate several games
4. Update standings
5. Display results

### Frontend Integration Testing
1. Start the backend server: `cd backend && python app.py`
2. Navigate to `/season` in the frontend
3. Create a new season in the Setup tab
4. Switch to Schedule tab and simulate games
5. Check Standings tab for updated records
